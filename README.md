# CinemaApplicationMVC
A cinema application for my MVC university assignment using .NET as a platform. This implementation includes Entity framework as the ORM for the dataaccess and the ORM for the user authentication and authentication. The user membership system of the project is Identity and I am also using a custom made email sending library.
